    # List tags for your role here, one per line. A tag is a keyword that describes
    # and categorizes the role. Users find roles by searching for tags. Be sure to
    # remove the '[]' above, if you add tags to this list.
    #
    # NOTE: A tag is limited to a single word comprised of alphanumeric characters.
    #       Maximum 20 tags per role.

# Ansible's built-in, magical 'never' tag means Galaxy will download these roles,
# but won't run them until a playbook explicitly calls them
